Projects completed during Data Science course
**Sprint #6 - Data Collection and Storage (SQL)**

You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. You'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

**Sprint #5 - Integrated Project 1**

You work for the online store Ice, which sells videogames all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This allows you to put your money on a potentially hot new item and plan advertising campaigns. In front of you is data going back to 2016. Let’s imagine that it’s December 2016 and you’re planning a campaign for 2017. The important thing is to get experience working with data. It doesn't really matter whether you're forecasting 2017 sales based on data from 2016 or 2027 sales based on data from 2026. The data set contains the abbreviation ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board). The ESRB evaluates a game's content and assigns an appropriate age categories, such as Teen and Mature.

**Sprint #4 - Statistical data analysis**

You work as an analyst for "Megaline", a state mobile operator. The company offers its clients two prepaid plans, Surf and Ultimate. The commercial department would like to know which of the plans is more profitable in order to adjust the advertising budget. You are going to carry out a preliminary analysis of the plans based on a relatively small client selection. You'll have the data on 500 "Megaline" clients, specifically, who the clients are, where they are from, which plan they use, the number of calls made and SMS they sent in 2018. You have to analyse clients' behavior and work out the most profitable prepaid plan.

**Sprint #3 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

You’ll have the data from Yandex.Realty provided for you. Working with data will not always be completely familiar - from time to time, you'll encounter data from peculiar sources, operating with peculiar measurements. Let's work with something exotic to keep you on your toes: a real estate agency has an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years. You’ll need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate properties. Your task is to define the parameters. This will make it possible to create an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraud. There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is a user’s input. The second type is received automatically based upon the map data. This could be calculated, for example, based upon the distance from the downtown area, airport, the nearest park or body of water.

**Sprint #2 - Data Preprocessing**

Your project is to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. You’ll need to find out if a customer’s marital status and number of children has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The bank already has some data on customers’ credit worthiness. Your report will be considered when building a credit scoring of a potential customer. A credit scoring is used to evaluate the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
